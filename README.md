# 👋 Hi, I'm Lee Clayberg

I'm a software engineer, mobile app developer, and lifelong builder who loves turning ideas into polished, real, usable products. I’ve built apps, games, tools, and even hardware projects across iOS, Android, Flutter, Unity, machine learning, and embedded systems.

For over a decade, I’ve created 80+ projects ranging from AI-powered apps to physics-based puzzle games, robotics experiments, and full-stack platforms — and I’m still building every day.
